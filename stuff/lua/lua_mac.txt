You need to recompile Lua in order to enable dynamic library support.
I've used the following project:
http://www.malcolmhardie.com/opensource/LuaFramework/
Just open it in Xcode, then in Build Settings search Other C Flags, add the following:
-DLUA_USE_DLOPEN -DLUA_USE_MACOSX
Output can be found in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
